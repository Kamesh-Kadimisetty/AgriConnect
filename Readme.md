# Agri Connect 🌿🔗

## 🔥 Inspiration

Agri Connect was inspired by the desire to create a comprehensive platform that addresses the diverse agricultural needs of farmers. We recognized the challenges faced by farmers in accessing relevant information, market trends, and agricultural assistance, and sought to develop a solution that would streamline these processes and empower farmers to make informed decisions.

## ❓ What it does

Agri Connect is a multifaceted platform that offers a range of features to support farmers in various aspects of agriculture:

- **Customized Assistance:** Our platform provides personalized crop recommendations based on soil fertility and weather reports, helping farmers optimize their yields.
- **Market Trends and Prices:** We leverage open APIs to deliver current market trends and prices, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about their produce.
- **Multilingual Support:** Agri Connect offers multilingual support in Telugu, Hindi, and English, catering to the diverse linguistic preferences of users. We have plans to expand to more languages in the future.
- **AI Chatbot:** Utilizing OpenAI, our chatbot is fine-tuned to provide relevant and helpful responses in multiple languages, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
- **Social Platform:** Similar to Facebook, Agri Connect allows users to share their farming experiences, updates, and challenges, fostering a supportive farming community.
- **Marketplace:** As a future enhancement, we plan to introduce a marketplace where farmers can showcase their products and retailers can offer machinery for rental and pesticides, promoting transparency and inclusivity in agricultural transactions.

## 🛠 How we built it

Agri Connect is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), providing a robust and scalable architecture for our platform. Additionally, we integrated machine learning APIs, such as crop recommendation, which are developed in Flask.

## 🦾 Challenges we ran into
